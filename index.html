<p>My week was interesting, I missed 2 days of school, and I had so much work to catch up on. I also had to take a test as soon as I came back to school. I had to practice on my 8th grade solo cheer, it was very easy. It only took like 30 mins, but I want to change some things. I also tried out for a flute solo, and I got it.
